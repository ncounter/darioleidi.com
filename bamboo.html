        <p class="mt-4">
          Bamboo is a card game for 2-4 players.

          The idea of the game comes from the purpose to get children training math and computation through a fun and engaging way.

          It is a game of strategy and luck, where players try to match an objective card with a combination of number and operator cards. The goal of the game is to get number and objective cards in the player’s solution pile. The player who has the most wins.

          <h5 class="mt-4">Bamboo and A.I.</h5>
          <p>Bamboo started as a paper drafted idea, but at some point I felt the need of balancing the game, and simulate how it might behave with different players, different amount of cards, different values of cards, and so on.</p>
          <p>Here it is where the <a href="https://github.com/GAIGResearch/TabletopGames" target="_blank">TAG (Tabletop Games)</a> framework kicked in and played its proper role. TAG is a JAVA framework that allows to simulate games and evaluate different strategies. After an initial basic understanding of the framework, I started the journey of implementing the Bamboo game in TAG. By implementing the game logic following TAG patterns, I am now able to simulate with the A.I. framework how the game would behave (statistically speaking) with a different types and amount of cards and players. That's how I came up with arbitrary setup amount of cards, amount of objective cards in the deck, copies of each number card, and so on.</p>
          <p>I would recommend TAG framework to all board game designers and developers after my experiences with it.</p>
          <p>Bamboo implementation in TAG is available <a href="https://github.com/ncounter/TabletopGames/tree/bamboo" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p class="mt-2">Note: a <strong>huge mention</strong> must be done afterwards: nothing could have happened of what was said above if it was not thanks for the collaboration with my dear friend and colleague <a href="https://github.com/moio" target="_blank">moio</a>.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          <h5 class="mt-4 manual-header">INITIAL SETUP STATE</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>3 number cards</li>
            <li>1 operator cards per player</li>
            <li>1 new objective card drawn, face-up</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 class="mt-4 manual-header">TURN</h5>
          The active player can do one of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a solution</li>
            <li>Pass the turn</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 class="mt-4 manual-header">PROVIDE A SOLUTION</h5>
          During their turn, a player finds a combination of number and operator cards to match the objective card.
          Operations are evaluated linearly, without parentheses:
          <ul>
            <li>Example: 7-4+2=5 <strong>is valid</strong></li>
            <li>Example: 7-4+2=1 evaluated as 7-[4+2]=7-6=1 <strong>is not valid</strong>.</li>
          </ul>

          The solution is explained and evaluated by the other players. If it is valid and confirmed, then:
          <ul>
            <li>Used number cards for the solution are placed in the solution pile of the player who solved it.</li>
            <li>The objective card goes into the same player’s solution pile.</li>
            <li>Operator cards of all players are reshuffled into the operator draw pile.</li>
            <li>Players restore their hand:
              <ul>
                <li>The solving player draws number cards until they have 3. If they have more, they can keep them for the next turn</li>
                <li>The solving player draws 1 operator cards</li>
                <li>Players who didn't solve must discard excess number cards until they have 3. All excess cards go into the solution pile of the player who solved.</li>
                <li>Players who didn't solve must draw 1 operator card</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5 class="mt-4 manual-header">PASS THE TURN</h5>
          The passing player can do one of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Draw 1 number card from the draw pile and draw 1 operator card from the draw pile.</li>
            <li>Draw 2 number cards from the number draw pile</li>
            <li>Draw 2 operator cards from the operator draw pile</li>
            <li>Swap all cards: put back current number and operator player's cards and redraw from the decks until they have the same amount as before</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 class="mt-4 manual-header">END OF GAME</h5>
          When the number card deck or the objective card deck is empty, finish the current round. If someone has solved, proceed to the end-of-turn steps. Otherwise, discard any unused cards and evaluate the winner.

          <h5 class="mt-4 manual-header">WINNER</h5>
          The player with the most number cards in their solution pile wins.

          <h5 class="mt-4 manual-header">COMPONENTS</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>45 number cards: 5 cards for each number, from 1 to 9</li>
            <li>32 operator cards: 16 "+" operator cards and 16 "-" operator cards</li>
            <li>20 objective cards: 1 cart for each number, from 1 to 20</li>
          </ul>
